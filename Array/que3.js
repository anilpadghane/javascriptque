/*Count Occurrences
You are given an array 
A
 containing 
N
 integer elements and an integer 
K
, and your task is to return the count of occurrences of 
K
 in array 
A
.

Note: You have to complete findCount function. No need to take any input.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers 
N
 and 
K
, denoting the number of elements in the array 
A
 and the element whose count needs to be determined, respectively.
The second line of the input contains 
N
 space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array 
A
